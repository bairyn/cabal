-- Basically, take a simple package, build it under two sets of build flags:
-- > (nothing)
-- > --enable-shared --enable-executable-dynamic --disable-library-vanilla
--
-- And ensure that whereas before they produced the same hash, now the package
-- hashes produced are different.  (And also supplementarily ensure that
-- re-running the same build with the same flags a second time produces a
-- deterministic hash too.)
